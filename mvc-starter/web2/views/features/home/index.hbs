<h1>Welcome to Coaching with Dylan Terry</h1>

<section class="intro">
  <p>
    Hello and welcome! I’m
    <strong>Dylan Terry</strong>, a virtual life coach here to help you navigate

  <h2>What is Life Coaching?</h2>
  <p>
    Life coaching is about progress—not perfection. It's a partnership focused
    on helping you move forward with purpose. Whether you want to reach a
    specific goal, overcome personal roadblocks, or create a more fulfilling
    life, I’m here to guide and support you. All sessions are held virtually,
    giving you the freedom to connect from anywhere—by phone or video—in a space
    where you feel most comfortable.

  <h2>Life Coaching vs. Therapy</h2>
  <p>
    Therapy focuses on healing the past. Life coaching, on the other hand, is
    future-focused and action-oriented. My role is to help you identify what’s
    next, set clear goals, and stay accountable to your own growth. Think of me
    as your coach and accountability partner—here to keep you motivated and
    moving forward.

<section class="about-me">
  <h2>Meet Dylan</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a 27-year-old coach originally from Arizona, now living in Salt Lake
    City. My passion for helping others came from my own journey—navigating
    difficult relationships, overcoming substance abuse, and managing a physical
    disability. These life experiences taught me about resilience, empowerment,
    and the importance of having someone in your corner.
  </p>

  <p>
    While therapy can be a powerful tool for deep emotional healing, I’ve found
    that sometimes people just need someone to talk to—someone who listens
    without judgment and helps them take the next step. That’s what I offer.
