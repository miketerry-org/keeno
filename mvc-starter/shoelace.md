Dark/Light mode ‚úÖ Built-in theme switching
Dark/light toggle example: Shoelace includes a theme switcher, or you can control it with JS.

2. Consider Adobe Spectrum Web Components (Advanced)
   If Shoelace doesn't fit all your visual needs or branding, Adobe Spectrum is another accessible-first library of web components.

High-quality accessibility (designed for Adobe users)
More ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù and heavier than Shoelace
May require more setup/config
Use this if you need very strict Adobe-styled design systems, otherwise Shoelace is easier.

3. Use Native HTML + Accessible HTML Patterns
   If you want to avoid any components and write plain HTML, you can use:

WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices
Gov.uk Design System (great accessibility, form components)
But these approaches will require more work and custom styling.
